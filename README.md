# Some Basic Facts

## Size

The current estimated population of the Sámi people is between 70,000 and 100,000 as it is hard to count the population because of the blurry lines of what is considered an identity marker and because of the cultural assimilation that occurred. Roughly half of the population live in Norway but others live in Sweden, Finland, and Russia. [^1]

## Language

Each branch of the Sámi has their own language which are closely related to each other but are not considered dialects as they do have their many differences. Many do not speak any of the Sámi languages and have undergone cultural alienation due to being absorbed into the dominant culture of society and the historic laws that prohibited the use of Sámi languages in schools and homes in Sweden and Norway. In fact traditional Sámi songs were illegal in Norway from 1773 to 1958, which is a violation of the universal human right of freedom of expression and right to share in your community’s cultural life. The Sámi people now speak the majority languages of the countries they inhabit, which would be Swedish, Russian, Finish, and Norwegian.

## Religion

The traditional Sámi religion that was practiced until the 17th century was a type of polytheism and animism which is the belief of the supernatural and that objects, places, and creatures all have a spiritual essence. Their religion was tied closely to the land and had a deep connection between the natural and spiritual worlds. They felt it was important to connect one's' personal spirituality with their daily life and it was very much at the forefront of their culture. They also engaged in ritual communication with the supernatural using drums, chants, or sacred objects, and practiced their religion at sacred sites like mountains, springs, or other land formations. However, when Christianiaty became the dominant religion in the 17th century, the Sámi were forced to practice their religion at home in private and had to attend church on Sundays. They were considered to have witchcraft powers and were accused of sorcery. In fact in 1720, the Sámi inhabitants of Norway had their drums or other sacred objects burned, and sacred sites destroyed because of __efforts to colonize and convert them.__ This was an explicit and forceful violation of the Sámi peoples __universal [human right](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) to religion and the ability to worship in peace and security.__ 


# Values relating to the Earth

The Sámi people perceive the earth as __the foundation of their livelihood__ and have developed their culture and spirituality around their land and its resources. They look to preserve ecology and biodiversity and are actively involved in many __conservation efforts__. The reason they think of the earth so highly is because their traditional occupations have always been centered around the land, for example, farming, cattle raising, trapping, and fishing. With being native to the north of Europe, Sámi people began to tame __reindeers__ into herding groups which grew the cultural and economic significance of these wild animals. They became such a large part of their lifestyle that they followed the seasonal migration of the reindeer. The practicality and resourcefulness of the land, however, was just one of the reasons the Sámi people valued the earth. They also practiced spirituality with a respectful, interconnected outlook on nature. __They saw the land as sacred__ and marked with holy sites such as stones, hills, springs, caves, and many more. These sites were used for prayers, offerings, or sacrifices which sat __at the heart of their religion and overall lifestyle__.
