# A Brief History of the Sámi People

The Sámi indigenous group inhabited their territory of __Northern Europe__, specifically Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Russian Kola Peninsula, around __2,000 years ago__ and in that span of time they have settled, created culture around their environment, and underwent colonization and the loss of their land. They call their ancestral land, __Sápmi__. The Sámi have even been thought of as __Europe’s only indigenous group__, yet there has been little done to preserve their culture and legacy. Although the Sámi are not bound to one state, they do have __a flag__ that represents their cultural identity . In general the Sámi flag __represents the Sámi people and their ties to the natural world__, but specifically the colors of the flag belong to colors from the __traditional Sámi clothing__ and the __circle symbol__ on the flag represents __the sun and the moon__. The flag flies on __Sámi National Day__ which is February 6th. For 25 years, there have been __many movements to reclaim the Sámi identity__ in order to __unite descendants and rediscover their history and culture__.

# Some Basic Facts

## Size

The current estimated population of the Sámi people is between __70,000 and 100,000__ as it is hard to count the population because of the blurry lines of what is considered an identity marker and because of the __cultural assimilation__ that occurred. Roughly half of the population live in Norway but others live in Sweden, Finland, and Russia. [^1]

### Branches

Within the umbrella term of the Sámi people, there are __10 branches__ of subgroups:

* Northern Sámi: population of 42,500, primarily located in Norway
* Lule Sámi: population of 8,000, primarily located in Sweden
* Pite Sámi: population of 2,000, primarily located in Sweden
* Southern Sámi: population of 1,200, primarily located in Sweden
* Ume Sámi: population of 1,000, primarily located in Sweden
* Skolt Sámi: population of 1,000, primarily located in Finland
* Kildin Sámi: population of 1,000, primarily located in Russia
* Inari Sámi: population of 900, primarily located in Finland
* Ter Sámi: population of 400, primarily located in Russia
* Akkala Sámi: population of 100, primarily located in Russia



## Language

Each branch of the Sámi has their own [language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjwQkOzzSAg) which are closely related to each other but are not considered dialects as they do have their many differences. Many do not speak any of the Sámi languages and have undergone __cultural alienation__ due to being absorbed into the dominant culture of society and the __historic laws that prohibited the use of Sámi languages__ in schools and homes in Sweden and Norway. In fact, __traditional Sámi songs were illegal__ in Norway from 1773 to 1958, which is a violation of the __universal [human right](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) of freedom of expression and right to share in your community’s cultural life__. The Sámi people now speak the majority languages of the countries they inhabit, which would be Swedish, Russian, Finish, and Norwegian.

## Religion

The traditional Sámi religion that was practiced until the 17th century was a type of polytheism and animism which is the belief of the supernatural and that objects, places, and creatures all have a spiritual essence. Their religion was tied closely to the land and had a deep connection between the natural and spiritual worlds. They felt it was important to connect ones personal spirituality with their daily life and it was very much at the forefront of their culture. They also engaged in ritual communication with the supernatural using __drums__, chants, or sacred objects, and practiced their religion at __sacred sites__ like mountains, springs, or other land formations. However, when Christianiaty became the dominant religion in the 17th century, the Sámi were forced to practice their religion at home in private and had to attend church on Sundays. They were considered to have witchcraft powers and were accused of sorcery. In fact, in 1720 the Sámi inhabitants of Norway had their __drums__ or other sacred objects burned, and sacred sites destroyed because of efforts to __colonize and convert them__. This was an explicit and forceful __violation of the Sámi peoples universal [human right](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) to religion and the ability to worship in peace and security__.

# Values Relating to the Earth

The Sámi people perceive the earth as __the foundation of their livelihood__ and have developed their culture and spirituality around their land and its resources. They look to preserve ecology and biodiversity and are actively involved in many __conservation efforts__. The reason they think of the earth so highly is because their traditional occupations have always been centered around the land, for example, farming, cattle raising, trapping, and fishing. With being native to the north of Europe, Sámi people began to tame __reindeer__ into herding groups which grew the cultural and economic significance of these wild animals. They became such a large part of their lifestyle that they followed the seasonal migration of the reindeer. The practicality and resourcefulness of the land, however, was just one of the reasons the Sámi people valued the earth. They also practiced spirituality with a respectful, interconnected outlook on nature. __They saw the land as sacred__ and marked with holy sites such as stones, hills, springs, caves, and many more. These sites were used for prayers, offerings, or sacrifices which sat __at the heart of their religion and overall lifestyle__.

# Environmental Challenges They Face

The Sámi people have more than 100 words to describe each type of snow yet __climate change__ is causing noticeable impacts. The warming arctic causes temperatures to rise and __snow to melt quicker or simply fall as rain__. Snow that is so ingrained in the culture of the Sámi people is slowly jeopardized by unnatural changes in climate. __Reindeer__, also important to culture and economy, are having harder times finding food and graze. Since the care of reindeers relies on identifying the type of snow, this new, unidentifiable snow __makes it harder to protect the reindeer__ and the traditional significance they carry. Sámi culture is so related to __animism, the idea that significant objects possess spirit,__ which makes that balance within the ecosystem even more vital. This imbalance caused by climate change could be detrimental to their culture and thus __the very essence of the Sámi people__.

# Legislative Action to Protect the Sámi People’s Rights and Breaches of Rights

__The ILO C 169, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989__, is an International Labor Organization Convention. Participation in this convention is a step towards securing the rights of indigenous peoples. Norway’s participation in this convention __secured the rights of the Sámi people__. This convention directly states in Article 14:

       label="Sami family-easter"
       description="Sami family at spring (Easter) celebration.">

_"1. The rights of ownership and possession of the peoples concerned over the lands which they traditionally occupy shall be recognised. In addition, measures shall be taken in appropriate cases to safeguard the right of the peoples concerned to use lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities.”_

       description="The Sámi Parliment building in Norway.">

It is one of many conventions that exist to __protect the rights of indigenous people.__ Another specific to the Sámi people is the Nordic Sami Convention ratified in 2017. It seeks to protect the rights of the Sámi people in the region of Finland, Norway, and Sweden, however __it proves insufficient in enforcement__, an example being in Sweden: 

<param ve-image
       url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Sami_camp_at_lake_Luossaj%C3%A4rvi%2C_Lappland%2C_Sweden_%289964732875%29.jpg"

       description="Sami camp at lake Luossajärvi near Kiruna in Lapland, Sweden.">

The Sámi people in Sweden have signed the Sámi Parliament Act or the “Samtingslag” as a form of __representation in Swedish politics__. It acts as a parliament within the Sámi people of Sweden, however due to its focus on cultural matters, it is a less effective form of representation in the national legislature. The Sámi in Sweden have a current status as an __“ethnic minority or as indigenous peoples”__ in the Swedish constitution, thus __they are not recognised as their own group of people__. While they do have freedom to participate in culture, __they do not have rights to land ownership__ under the basis of being part of the Sámi people. This is a __violation of the right of self-determination and the right to govern themselves,__ as the land that belongs to the Sámi people is being governed by the Swedish government.

       description="Composition of the Sami Parliament of Norway as of the election on 11 September 2017.">
       

Despite Sweden being a signatory to the Nordic Saami Convention, it continues to breach its agreements as well as article 26 of the [United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples](https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/11/UNDRIP_E_web.pdf):

       description="Albumen print of three Sámi (Lapp) women, one smoking a pipe, wearing their traditional caps.">
       
       
_“Indigenous peoples have the right to own, develop, control and use the lands and territories, including the total environment of the lands, air, waters, coastal seas, sea-ice, flora and fauna and other resources which they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used. This includes the right to the full recognition of their laws, traditions and customs, land-tenure systems and institutions for the development and management of resources, and the right to effective measures by States to prevent any interference with, alienation of or encroachment upon these rights.”_

This breach of agreement allows legislation like __the Mineral Act__ to exist. Enacted in 1991, it allows the Swedish mining companies to __take advantage of indigenous land__ without consulting those who have rightful claim to it. This act also has no mention of the Sámi’s ability to prevent these operations. This is due to __Sweden’s lack of recognition of the Sámi people’s land rights__, directly affecting their self-determination. While they have self-determination on cultural matters, the fundamental human right to live on their own land are vague and this __lack of control over their own affairs is a breach of their right to self-determination__.
